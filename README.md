#TRELLOL

####A derpy little app for interfacing with Trello.

To use the app, grab your own api key from [trello.](https://developers.trello.com/authorize)

Place this api key into the api script link in `index.html` after `key=`

###TO RUN:

run `npm run run` and visit `localhost:3002` or assign your port with PORT=`number`

###TODO
* Refactor `front.js` into a cleaner collection of js files
* Decide on DB use, or just JSON file store
* Add weekly information screen
* MORE FUN THINGS WITH VISUALS

###TODO NEXT:
* Mirror gui commands to cli commands
* Add webhooks for grabbing from Trello
* Decide on electron use
* Add card-movement commands to cli
* Add CLI visuals
* Import MD doc of headers/lists into board/list/cards

###~BUGS~ FEATURES:
* Being a worthless app
